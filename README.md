# Coursera_project
This is the final project for coursera

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset for this project was used 

dplyr and tidyr were used to help format the data

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we (the group who collected the data) captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.  

The data merges several different datasets. Orginally the data was split into a test and training set in which we have
now combined and made the columns headers our variables. We then only took the mean and standard deviation calculations
and made their names a bit cleaner so when we made the data tidy it was easier to understand what each variable meant.

Finally, a group average column for subject_now and activity was made in final_answer



run_analysis.R is the R code for the project
